# Password-generator

JavaScript code for a password generator website 

## Description

I was provided with basic HTML CSS with a button to generate a password. I was also provided with some arrays containing character types. Based on this information, I used Javascript to create a password generator with the following conditions:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
